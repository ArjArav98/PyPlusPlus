1. We cannot "cout" the result of an operation. For example;
var a=12;
var b=13;
cout<<a+b<<endl;
This is not possible. I think it might have something to do with the fact that when an operation happens on two vars, it returns a new var. This might mess with the ostream overload function.

2. This might be a continuation of the first issues. We cannot print an individual element of a list.

3. The toString() function in the var.h header file will leak memory everytime it is used. We must find a way to fix this. Or else, we must either learn to ignore the memory leakage or scrap the function altogether.


TO DO!!!
1. Need to make sure the update() and cout overload in the dict.h are proper. There is something wrong with them.
